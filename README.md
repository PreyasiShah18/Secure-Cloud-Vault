## AWS S3 Bucket Management System

This project involved setting up a secure file management system using Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 buckets. The goal was to create a platform where users could securely register, log in, and upload/download files.

### AWS Setup

1. **AWS Account Creation:** I created a new AWS account to access AWS services.
2. **S3 Bucket Configuration:** I set up an S3 bucket to store files uploaded by users securely.

### Application Development

1. **Web Application Development:** I developed a simple web application using Flask, ensuring a smooth user experience.
2. **User Functionality Implementation:** I implemented user registration, login, and file upload/download functionality to facilitate seamless interaction.
3. **AWS SDK Integration:** I integrated AWS SDKs, such as boto3 for Python, to enable interaction with the S3 bucket from the application code.

### IAM Permissioning

1. **IAM Policies Definition:** I defined IAM policies to restrict access to the S3 bucket based on user roles, ensuring secure data handling.
2. **IAM Roles for Users:** I created IAM roles for different user types, such as administrators and regular users. For administrators, I devised JSON policies granting full access to S3 resources, while for regular users, I implemented policies ensuring read-only access. These measures upheld stringent access control, fostering secure data management practices within the system.
3. **Secure Access Assurance:** I ensured that only authenticated users with the correct permissions could perform actions like uploading/downloading files to/from the S3 bucket, enhancing system security.

### IAM Roles and Policies Documentation

1. **IAM Role for S3 Access:** I created an IAM role granting permissions for actions such as `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, and `s3:DeleteObject` on the S3 bucket to enable smooth file operations.
2. **IAM Roles for Application Users:** I defined AdminRole and RegularUserRole with appropriate permissions to manage user access effectively.
3. **S3 Bucket Access Role for File Upload:** I set up an IAM role granting EC2 instances permission to upload files to the designated S3 bucket, ensuring seamless file transfer.
4. **AWSServiceRoleForSupport and AWSServiceRoleForTrustedAdvisor:** I configured service-linked roles used by AWS services for specific operations, ensuring smooth service integration.

Through this project, I successfully established a secure file management system in AWS S3 buckets with granular access control and user authentication, contributing to enhanced data security and user experience.
